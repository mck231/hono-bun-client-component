# Hono + Bun Basic Client Component Example
This is a simple project that demonstrates how to build a basic Hono app with Bun, including a client-side component rendered using `hono/jsx`.

## Overview
This project is split into **server-side** and **client-side** code:

- **Server-Side Code**: Runs on the Bun runtime using Hono as the framework to serve the HTML and handle requests. Bun doesn't provide a DOM environment, so any code related to the DOM must be executed in the browser.

- **Client-Side Code**: Runs in the browser. This includes rendering interactive components like a counter, which is handled using `hono/jsx/dom`.

The server serves an HTML page with a root element (`#root`), and the client-side JavaScript is responsible for rendering components dynamically into that root.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**  
   First, make sure you have Bun installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

2. **Running the Project**  
   To start the development server and bundle the client-side code:

    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```

   This will do two things:
    - Bundle the client-side code from `src/client.tsx` into `static/client.js`.
    - Start the Bun server with hot reloading using `src/index.tsx`.

3. **Open the App**  
   Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   You should see a basic app with a counter component that you can increment.

## Project Structure

- **src/index.tsx**: The entry point for the server-side code. This file uses Hono to define routes and serve static files. It also renders an HTML page that includes the `client.js` file.

- **src/client.tsx**: The client-side entry point. This file renders interactive components, such as a counter, inside the `#root` element.

- **components/App.tsx**: The shared component code. This file defines the `App` component, which contains the `Counter` component. This is used both on the server (for static rendering) and in the browser (for interactive updates).

- **static/client.js**: The client-side bundle generated by Bun. This file is automatically created when you run the project, and it contains the code needed to make the app interactive in the browser.

## Client-Side Code

The client-side JavaScript is bundled using Bun. When you run the `bun run dev` command, Bun processes the `src/client.tsx` file and outputs the bundled JavaScript to `static/client.js`.

The `client.js` file is responsible for rendering and managing components in the browser. It uses `hono/jsx/dom` to interact with the DOM and update the UI dynamically. Here's how it works:

- The server sends a static HTML page with a `#root` element.
- The `client.js` file, which is loaded in the browser, uses `hono/jsx/dom` to render components inside this `#root` element, making the app interactive.

## No DOM on the Server

Since Bun runs server-side code, there is no access to the DOM in the server environment. All DOM manipulation must happen in the client-side code. That's why the `client.js` file is generated and executed in the browser, where it has access to the DOM.
